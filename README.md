## 📋 Overview
This project is an **end-to-end AI microservice application** optimized for real-time object detection in autonomous driving scenarios.

The system has been re-engineered from a heavy **Keras-based architecture** to a lightweight and high-performance **TFLite (TensorFlow Lite)** inference engine. The model is served via a **FastAPI** backend and containerized with **Docker** for scalable deployment, featuring a **Streamlit** frontend for interactive testing.

---

## ⚡ Key Features
- **Optimized Inference (TFLite):** Switched from heavy Keras models to **TFLite (Float32)**, significantly reducing RAM usage and latency.
- **Microservice Architecture:** Decoupled architecture with a FastAPI backend and Streamlit frontend communicating via HTTP.
- **Orchestrated Deployment:** Uses a custom `start.sh` script to manage multi-process (API + Frontend) execution within a single Docker container.
- **Auto-Model Fetching:** Model weights are automatically downloaded from the cloud upon the first run.
- **Robust Preprocessing:** Custom Letterbox resizing and coordinate recovery logic ensures high precision mapping.

🧠 Model & Dataset

The model is based on the YOLOv8 architecture, fine-tuned on a Self-Driving Cars Dataset.

- Format: .tflite (TensorFlow Lite Float32)

- Input Shape: (1, 640, 640, 3)

Detected Classes

🟢 Car

🔵 Truck

🔴 Pedestrian

🟣 Cyclist

🚀 How to Run

You can run this project using Docker (Recommended) or directly with Python.

Option 1: Run with Docker (Recommended) 🐳

This method prevents dependency conflicts and ensures a consistent environment.

Build the Image
```
docker build -t yolo-autonomous-app .
```

Run the Container
```
docker run -p 8501:8501 yolo-autonomous-app
```

(Note: The container runs both FastAPI (Internal 8000) and Streamlit (Exposed 8501))
Access the App 👉 http://localhost:8501

Option 2: Run Locally (Python) 🐍

Clone the Repository
```
git clone [https://github.com/alperenndemirbas/YOLOv8-Autonomous-Driving](https://github.com/alperenndemirbas/YOLOv8-Autonomous-Driving)
cd YOLOv8-Autonomous-Driving
```

Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the Backend
```
uvicorn api:app --reload
```

Wait for the log: ✅ Model ready...

Start the Frontend (in a new terminal)
```
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

🔍 Technical Analysis & Future Work
📊 Performance Analysis

- Status: Prototype / Proof of Concept.

- Current Success: Excellent detection of vehicles in daylight conditions.

- Optimization Gains: Switching to TFLite reduced container size and memory usage by approximately 60%, enabling deployment on free-tier cloud   instances.

📉 Confusion Matrix (CM) Analysis

The Confusion Matrix shows high accuracy for the Car class, while Pedestrian, Cyclist, and Traffic Light exhibit relatively lower performance.

Root Cause:
Class imbalance in the dataset, where the Car class is overrepresented.

📈 Future Improvements
- Data Augmentation: Increasing samples for underrepresented classes (Pedestrians/Cyclists).

- Scenario Diversity: Adding rain, fog, and night-time datasets.

- Training: Increasing epochs with Early Stopping to prevent overfitting.

- Model Scaling: Fine-tuning larger YOLOv8 variants (Medium/Large) for detecting small/distant objects.

⚡ Impact of TFLite Conversion
Beyond speed and memory efficiency, the TFLite conversion provided:

- More stable inference on CPU-only environments.

- Faster cold-start times on serverless platforms.

📌 Conclusion
This project presents a lightweight, scalable, and real-time object detection system for autonomous driving scenarios. Transitioning from a heavy Keras architecture to an optimized TFLite microservice demonstrates a practical and efficient approach to deploying AI on edge devices and cloud platforms.
